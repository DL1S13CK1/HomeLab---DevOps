# Homelab DevOps – practical portfolio

This repository documents my DevOps learning journey using a **Raspberry Pi 5 homelab**.  
The goal is to build a small-scale environment that reflects real-world DevOps practices:  
from containerization, through automation, to orchestration and Infrastructure as Code.  

---

## 🚀 Tech stack (planned)
- Linux (terminal, SSH, server management)  
- Docker & Docker Compose (containerization)  
- Ansible (provisioning & automation)  
- Kubernetes ( K8s / k3s / microk8s)  
- Terraform (Infrastructure as Code experiments)  

---

## 📂 Repository structure (work in progress)

- `01-docker-compose-playground/` → first multi-service stack in Docker Compose  
- `02-ansible-provisioning/` → Ansible playbook for provisioning and deployments  
- `03-kubernetes-lab/` → basic Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service, Ingress)  
- `04-iac-experiments/` → first Terraform experiments  

---

## 🎯 Project goals
- Practice DevOps tools hands-on.  
- Document learning progress step by step.  
- Build a portfolio project to showcase DevOps skills.
